# The AI web.

There is probably no creative industry that won't be deeply affected by generative AI. The web design is no exception. But designing a website with AI can be quite challenging. You may find yourself asking many questions like:

-   Which **tool** should I use?
-   What **version** of that tool?
-   How should I **prompt** it?
-   What **upscale** should I use?
-   Does the page look good on all **devices**?
-   Picking the right **colors** and _fonts_

We have great tools such as [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/), [MidJourney](https://www.midjourney.com/), [Dalle-2](https://openai.com/dall-e-2), as well as many models for [Stable diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/). However, **these are not web generators**; they are great building blocks that require balancing, tweaking, and a considerable amount of expertise and time. _You need bricks to build a house, but bricks alone are not enough._

> So we created the easy way to design your own web using generative AI.

Sounds incredible? You are now on such a website - the page you are on is an example of a fully AI-designed website.

### Mix it yourself!

You don't need to be an experienced prompt engineer or even think about AI tools at all. Just go through the gallery of ready-made webs and if you ♥️ one you can claim one, its just that easy:

1.  Just take that **web** and have it **live in 5 minutes**
2.  _(optional)_ Export the template for your system like WordPress, Webflow, Wix, Nette or take it as a first prototype for webdesigner
3.  _(optional)_ Take the prompts and a starting point and make super fitting AI web just by yourself but with huge initial help of first kickoff
