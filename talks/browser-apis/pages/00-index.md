## What is a web API?

> Web (browser) API vs API service

> When writing code for the Web, there are a large number of Web APIs available. Below is a link to of all the APIs and interfaces (object types) that you may be able to use while developing your Web app or site.

> Web APIs are typically used with JavaScript, although this doesn't always have to be the case.

There are a **looooooooooooooooooot** of them
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API

I picked:

-   [**Web Speech API**](10-web-speech-api): For using the user's voice to control the web apps.
-   [**Sensor APIs**](10-web-speech-api): Provides access to different sensors on a user's device, such as an accelerometer or gyroscope.
-   [**WebXR**](30-webxr.md): Allows developers to create virtual and augmented reality experiences in the browser.
-   [**Internationalisation API**](40-internationalisation-api.md): Provides a way to format dates, times, numbers, currencies, and more.
-   [**Offscreen Canvas API**](50-offscreen-canvas-api.md): Allows developers to perform graphics operations outside of the main thread, improving performance.
-   [**File system access API**](60-file-system-access-api.md): Provides a way for web applications to read and write files on a user's device.
